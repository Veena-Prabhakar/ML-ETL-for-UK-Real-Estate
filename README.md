# README - MSc Dissertation ML-ETL

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) middleware integrated with machine learning techniques for real estate data analytics - ML-ETL. The system provides functionality for data extraction, transformation, and predictive modeling of property prices using a combination of demographic, economic, and real estate-specific data and finally loading it into database for analysis.

## Project Structure

- **Code**: This folder contains all the Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) necessary for the ML- ETL process.
  - `main.ipynb`: The main notebook that orchestrates the entire ETL process. Running this notebook will execute all the relevant notebooks in the correct sequence.
  - `Data Extraction.ipynb`: Handles the extraction of data from various sources.
  - `Data Preprocessing, Feature Selection, Predicted Price.ipynb`: Performs data preprocessing and feature selection with price prediction.
  - `Data Transformation.ipynb`: Conducts data augmentation and transformation.
  - `Data Initial Loading.ipynb`: Responsible for loading the initial data into the system.
  - `Data Incremental Loading.ipynb`: Manages incremental updates to the data mart.
  - `Initial Load Testing.ipynb` & `Incremental Load Testing.ipynb`: Validates the loading process.
  - `Price Prediction Test.ipynb`: Suite using the machine learning models for price prediction.

- **Data/Input**: Contains the input datasets used for the project.
- **Data/Output**: Stores the outputs generated by the notebooks after executing the ETL and ML processes.
- **Logs/Info & Logs/Error**: Contains logs and error message for each run.
- **Results**: Stores the analytical results such as predictions, validation metrics, and reports.
- **Scripts**: Contains Python scripts used for custom functions and data transformations.
- **Models**: Contains final saved models and Pipelines.
- **UK_Real_Estate_DB_PostgreSQL.sql**: Contains the database export file which needs to be imported into PostgreSQL for setting up the data mart.
- **UK_Real_Estate_DB_PowerBI.pbix**: contains pre-built Power BI dashboards that visualize the results from the ETL and predictive analysis processes, providing insights into the real estate market trends.

## How to Use

### 1. Download the Zipped Folder
The zipped folder, **MSc Dissertation Zipped version**, contains all necessary contents, including:
- Code
- Input data
- Output data
- Results
- Custom scripts

### 2. Unzip the Folder
Once the folder is downloaded, unzip it to access the entire project structure.

### 3. Import Database into PostgreSQL
To set up the database required for the project:
1. Open **pgAdmin** and create a new database.
2. Import the **`UK_Real_Estate_DB_PostgreSQL.sql`** file into the newly created database.
   - This SQL file contains the entire database schema and data necessary for the ETL and ML processes.
   - Ensure the database connection is configured correctly for the loading and transformation stages to run successfully.

### 4. Run the Code
To execute the code and run the entire ETL and ML pipeline:
1. Open the **`main.ipynb`** notebook located in the **Code** folder.
2. Run all the cells in `main.ipynb`, which will sequentially execute all the other `.ipynb` files in the project.

### 5. Data and Results
The system will process the data, perform transformations, and generate predictions and load into the database. You can find the results in the **Results** folder after execution.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the required libraries installed before running the notebooks
UK_Real_Estate_DB_PostgreSQL.sql has to be imported
